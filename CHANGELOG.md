## 0.1.0

- Include a command line tool that allows you to update `AndroidManifest.xml` and `Info.plist` files.
- For safety, it always uses the testing unit IDs in debug mode.
- For easy cross-platform, we use silent failure instead of throwing exceptions on unsupported platforms.
- For better readability, all parameters have default values.
- Support Android/iOS
