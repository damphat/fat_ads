# TODO
- [x] Avoid making users wait for ads when launching the app. To ensure a seamless experience, preload the ads while the user is actively using the app. Then, upon launching the app, simply check if the ads have already been loaded and display them immediately.
- [ ] On unsupported ads platforms, FatAds remains silent without displaying any error messages
- [ ] rename to OpenAppAds
# QUESTION
